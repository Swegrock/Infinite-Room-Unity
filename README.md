# Infinite-Room-Unity
A unity implementation of the non-euclidean rotating room.
I was inspired by this here https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/gcnncg/the_main_menu_cinematic_for_my_new_game_combining/.
And credit to here https://forum.unity.com/threads/scissor-rectangle.37612/ for the camera scissoring script.
The irony is that the scissoring script is the only interesting bit of code, oh well.

Here's an idea for anyone interested in making this better.
Collisions could be eliminated fully by using positions instead. Then from there you can start combining scripts.
